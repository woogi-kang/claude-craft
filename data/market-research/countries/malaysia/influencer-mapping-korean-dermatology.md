# Malaysia Influencer Mapping: Korean Dermatology & Beauty Clinics

**Research Date:** 2026-02-13
**Scope:** Malaysian influencers covering Korean dermatology/beauty treatments, Korean creators targeting Malaysia, agency/brand partnerships
**Methodology:** Web search across influencer databases (Modash, HypeAuditor, Feedspot, StarNgage, Inbeat), industry publications (BURO Malaysia, Beauty Insider MY, Harper's Bazaar SG), medical tourism sources, and social media platforms

---

## Executive Summary

The Malaysian-Korean dermatology influencer landscape is **nascent but growing rapidly**. Unlike Japan (where a mature YouTube/blog ecosystem exists for Korean clinic reviews), Malaysia's influencer coverage of Korean dermatology is primarily **indirect** -- through K-beauty product reviews, general Korean aesthetic clinic content, and lifestyle vlogs that occasionally touch on skin treatments. There is a significant **whitespace opportunity**: no dominant Malaysian influencer has built a dedicated brand around Korean dermatology clinic experiences.

Key findings:
- **1,284 Malaysians** traveled to Korea for medical tourism in 2022, with **17% for dermatology** (ranked 23rd among sending countries)
- K-beauty product content is abundant; Korean **clinic-specific** content from Malaysian creators is scarce
- **Korean-owned clinics in Malaysia** (Ozhean, BBS Clinic, Clinic RX, Xeoul) serve as a bridge, bringing Korean dermatology techniques locally
- **Xiaohongshu (RED)** is an emerging but under-researched channel for Malaysian Chinese users seeking Korean clinic reviews
- **Medical tourism agencies** (BeautyHopper, Seoul Guide Medical, Beauty Therapy Korea) use influencer marketing but few Malaysian KOLs are part of their roster

## 6. Xiaohongshu (RED) / Chinese-Language Channel

### Current State
- **Limited research available** for Malaysian-specific Korean clinic content on Xiaohongshu
- Xiaohongshu is a crucial platform for medical aesthetics marketing in China (per Octopus Media whitepaper)
- MCN Asia (Singapore-based) is the official Xiaohongshu Sales Partner for SEA healthcare marketing
- Malaysian Chinese users likely consume Korean clinic content on RED but no specific Malaysian KOLs were identified

### Opportunity
- Malaysia's Chinese-speaking population (~23% of total) represents an untapped channel
- Xiaohongshu word-of-mouth is already driving Korean beauty service demand in China
- MCN Asia could activate Malaysian Chinese influencers on RED for Korean dermatology content

## 7. Gap Analysis & Opportunities

### Major Gaps Identified

1. **No dedicated Malaysian Korean dermatology vlogger** -- Unlike Japan/China where creators build entire channels around Korean clinic visits, no Malaysian creator has carved this niche
2. **No Malaysian influencer on Seoul Cosmetic Surgery's roster** -- The largest Korean medical tourism influencer program has zero Malaysian representation
3. **TikTok is underutilized** -- Malaysia's top 15 beauty TikTok creators (each with 800K+ MY followers) produce zero Korean dermatology content
4. **Xiaohongshu gap** -- No identified Malaysian Chinese KOLs posting Korean clinic experiences on RED
5. **Male skincare influencers untapped** -- Dr. Ingky (2.3M TikTok likes) and Ismail Roslyy cover skincare but not Korean clinic treatments

### Strategic Opportunities

1. **Partner with Dr. Ingky** for credible, dermatologist-endorsed Korean treatment content (bilingual Malay/English reach)
2. **Activate top TikTok creators** (Nelysa Norazlan, Zee, Kak Dino) for Korean clinic trip vlogs -- massive untapped reach (2M+ MY followers each)
3. **Leverage Ozhean Malaysia** as a "gateway" brand -- Malaysians can experience Korean dermatology locally before committing to Seoul trips
4. **MCN Asia + Xiaohongshu** -- Chinese-language Korean clinic content for Malaysian Chinese audience
5. **AJ Marketing's K-celebrity network** -- Pair Malaysian influencers with Korean dermatologist endorsements
6. **Seoul Cosmetic Surgery influencer program** -- Recruit Malaysian creators to fill the representation gap

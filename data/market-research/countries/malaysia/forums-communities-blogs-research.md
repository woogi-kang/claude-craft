# Malaysia: Forums, Communities & Blog Research
## How Malaysians Discover, Evaluate, and Book Korean Dermatology/Beauty Clinics

**Research Date:** 2026-02-13
**Focus:** Online communities, forums, blogs, review platforms, and social media discovery channels

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Malaysian interest in Korean dermatology and aesthetic clinics is significant and growing, driven primarily by K-culture influence (K-dramas, K-pop). However, unlike markets such as China or Japan, Malaysia lacks a single dominant online community dedicated to Korean medical beauty tourism. Instead, discovery and evaluation are **fragmented across multiple platforms**: social media (TikTok, Instagram, XiaoHongShu), international booking platforms (Creatrip, Gangnam Unni), and to a lesser extent, traditional forums (Lowyat.net). WhatsApp-based consultation with Korean clinics and medical tourism agencies is a key booking channel.

**Key statistics:**
- Korea attracted **1.17 million** foreign medical tourists in 2024 (93.2% YoY growth)
- **705,000** (56.6%) were dermatology patients -- a **117-fold increase** since 2009
- Southeast Asia accounted for **112,000** patients (9.6%) in 2024
- Malaysia sent **1,284** patients in 2022 (plastic surgery 40%, internal medicine 20%, dermatology 17%)
- **69.3%** of Southeast Asian medical tourists cite K-culture as their primary influence

## 2. Online Forums and Communities

### 2.1 Lowyat.net (Malaysia's Largest Forum)

**URL:** https://forum.lowyat.net
**Language:** English, some Malay (Bahasa Malaysia)
**Relevance:** Moderate -- discussions exist but are not highly active for Korean medical tourism specifically

**Key Findings:**
- **"Traveling to Korea for plastic surgery"** thread ([link](https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/2708072/all)): 32 posts, ~5,161 views (2013-2016). Discusses Grand, Oz, and VIP clinics in Apgujeong. Focuses on surgical procedures (jaw, cheek, breast augmentation, rhinoplasty). No dermatology content.
- **"South Korea V6"** general travel thread ([link](https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/4064199)): Active travel discussion but focused on logistics (T-money cards, hotels, attractions). No medical tourism or skin clinic content found.
- **Multiple skin specialist recommendation threads**: Focused on *local* Malaysian dermatologists (Dr. Ting, Dr. Ranjit Singh, Ko Skin Specialist) rather than Korean clinics.
- **Korean skincare product threads**: Discussions about Laneige, Etude House, The Face Shop, Nature Republic products -- consumer products, not clinic visits.

**Sentiment:** Malaysian Lowyat users express distrust of local surgeons for complex procedures and recommend Korean clinics for superior expertise. Key concerns include post-operative complications, inadequate aftercare, and unethical practices at some clinics.

**Gap identified:** No dedicated Lowyat subforum or active thread specifically for Korean dermatology/skin clinic experiences. This represents a content gap that could be addressed.

### 2.2 Reddit

**Relevant subreddits:** r/malaysia, r/AsianBeauty, r/MalaysianPF
**Language:** English
**Relevance:** Low to Moderate

**Key Findings:**
- Direct searches for "Malaysia Korean skin clinic" on Reddit returned **no specific results**.
- r/AsianBeauty has an **official Discord server** ([link](https://discord.com/servers/asian-beauty-241620846467088384)) that serves as a community for Asian beauty discussions including Korean skincare, but clinic-specific medical tourism content is sparse.
- Malaysian users on Reddit are more likely to discuss **Korean skincare products** than clinic visits.
- When dermatology is discussed, the focus is typically on local Malaysian options or general K-beauty product routines.

**Gap identified:** Reddit is not a primary channel for Malaysian Korean medical tourism discovery. Content here would need to be seeded to build community.

### 2.3 Facebook Groups

**Language:** Mixed (English, Malay, Mandarin depending on group)
**Relevance:** Moderate to High (based on general Malaysian social media usage patterns)

**Key Findings:**
- Direct web searches did not surface **specific named Facebook groups** dedicated to Korean beauty medical tourism for Malaysians.
- Facebook remains one of Malaysia's most-used social platforms, so private/closed groups likely exist but are not indexed by search engines.
- Korean aesthetic clinics operating in Malaysia (Ozhean, BBS Clinic, Clinic RX) maintain active Facebook pages used for marketing and community engagement.

**Assessment:** Facebook groups are likely a significant but **invisible** channel -- private groups for Korean medical tourism would need to be discovered through direct Facebook search or word-of-mouth referrals. This warrants further investigation directly on the Facebook platform.

### 2.4 WhatsApp / Telegram Groups

**Language:** Various
**Relevance:** Evidence of channel usage but groups are private

**Key Findings:**
- Multiple Korean medical tourism agencies actively use **WhatsApp** for consultation and booking:
  - **MEDICTEL**: WhatsApp +82 10-7345-0608
  - **Dr.Sonyouna clinic**: WhatsApp +8210-7538-3443
  - **Yeongjong Central Dermatology**: 24/7 WhatsApp consultation
  - **Seoul Delight Dermatology**: WhatsApp booking option
- No publicly listed WhatsApp or Telegram groups specifically for Malaysian Korean beauty medical tourism were found.
- General Asian Telegram group directories exist but no specific Korean beauty/medical tourism groups for Malaysians were identified.

**Assessment:** WhatsApp is likely the **primary 1-to-1 booking channel** between Malaysian patients and Korean clinics/agencies, but community groups (if they exist) are entirely private and not discoverable through web search.

### 2.5 WeChat / XiaoHongShu (RedNote) -- Chinese Malaysian Community

**Language:** Mandarin Chinese
**Relevance:** HIGH for Chinese Malaysians (significant demographic)

**XiaoHongShu (RedNote) Key Statistics:**
- **2.5+ million** users in Malaysia
- Primary demographic: Ethnic-Chinese women aged **18-35**
- **84%** of young Malaysian respondents use XiaoHongShu as their primary pre-purchase reference
- Beauty and skincare **dominate** conversations on the platform
- Users share detailed routines for hyperpigmentation, acne, and sun protection

**XiaoHongShu and Korean Clinics:**
- The platform is a **major discovery channel** for Korean beauty clinics globally
- Users look up "best clinics, surgeries, or beauty salons -- even in places like Korea"
- Influencers and targeted ads on the platform directly link consumers with Korean clinics
- Chinese consumers are driven by desire to achieve K-celebrity aesthetics
- Post-pandemic surge in medical tourism from China (and by extension, Chinese diaspora in Malaysia) is heavily XiaoHongShu-influenced

**Assessment:** XiaoHongShu/RedNote is the **single most important discovery platform** for Chinese Malaysians seeking Korean dermatology clinics. This is a critical channel to monitor and engage with.

### 2.6 Discord Communities

**Language:** English
**Relevance:** Low

**Key Findings:**
- **r/AsianBeauty Discord** ([link](https://discord.com/servers/asian-beauty-241620846467088384)): Discussions about Asian beauty products, skincare reviews. Product-focused rather than clinic-focused.
- General skincare Discord servers exist on [DISBOARD](https://disboard.org/servers/tag/skincare) but none specifically for Korean medical tourism.
- No Malaysian-specific Discord communities for Korean beauty clinics were identified.

## 3. Blog Platforms and Content Creators

### 3.1 Malaysian Beauty Blogs

**Key Malaysian beauty bloggers/influencers covering K-beauty:**

| Blogger | Platform | Focus | Notes |

| **The Yum List** | WordPress ([link](https://www.theyumlist.net/)) | Lifestyle + Beauty | Reviewed Ozhean's Dr. Park Ji Youn |

**Observations:**
- Malaysian beauty bloggers primarily cover **K-beauty products** (skincare routines, product reviews) rather than Korean clinic experiences.

- **230 skincare influencers** with majority Malaysian audiences were identified (per Modash.io data, Jan 2026).
- **Gap identified:** Very few Malaysian bloggers create dedicated Korean clinic visit/experience content. This is a significant content opportunity.

### 3.2 Dayre

**Status:** Not active/relevant. Searches for Dayre + Korean beauty + Malaysia returned no meaningful results. The platform appears to have declined in relevance for the Malaysian market.

### 3.3 Lemon8

**URL:** https://www.lemon8-app.com

- Singapore-region content features Korean clinic reviews that Malaysian users likely access.
- Posts include warnings about negative experiences (e.g., "AVOID THIS CLINIC IN KOREA" post from Singapore-based user).

**Assessment:** Lemon8 is an emerging platform for clinic discovery among younger Malaysian users, serving as a bridge between TikTok short-form content and longer-form review content.

- #KBeauty: **1.4 million posts** on TikTok.

## 7. Key Concerns and Sentiment Analysis

### Concerns Raised by Malaysian Users (across all platforms)

1. **Pricing transparency**: Foreigner clinics in Korea charge **2-4x more** than prices listed on Naver for Korean locals.
2. **Over-treatment risk**: Clinics recommend too many procedures in a single visit; users warn to split treatments across multiple days.
3. **Language barriers**: Preference for English-speaking staff; smaller clinics vary in English proficiency.
4. **Post-operative care**: Concerns about inadequate follow-up when returning to Malaysia after procedures in Korea.
5. **Clinic verification**: Uncertainty about which clinics are legitimate vs. "factory-style" foreigner-targeting operations.
6. **Cost vs. local alternatives**: Evaluating whether traveling to Korea is worth it compared to Korean-founded clinics in Malaysia (Ozhean, BBS, etc.).

### Positive Sentiment Themes

1. **Superior expertise**: Korean dermatologists perceived as world-leading in skin treatments.
2. **Advanced technology**: Korean clinics offer treatments not yet available in Malaysia.
3. **Cost-effectiveness**: Even with travel, Korean treatments can be cheaper than equivalent treatments in Western countries.
4. **K-culture alignment**: Trust in Korean beauty standards driven by K-drama and K-pop influence.
5. **Glass skin aspiration**: Strong desire for the "Korean glass skin" aesthetic.

    "gap_analysis": {
      "finding": "There is NO dedicated Taiwanese influencer for Korean dermatology/clinic tourism. Taiwan has a mature beauty influencer ecosystem (Hello Catie 1.09M, Alisasa 1.2M, etc.) that extensively covers Korean beauty PRODUCTS, but virtually none cover Korean CLINIC visits, dermatology treatments, or medical tourism. The closest is Fion (podcast host living in Korea) who has one episode about Korean medical aesthetics, and anonymous Dcard/PTT users who share personal experiences.",
      "opportunity": "Taiwan sent 1.5 million visitors to Korea in 2024. Korean medical tourism from Taiwan grew 867% post-COVID. Yet no single Taiwanese creator has claimed the 'Korean dermatology tourism' niche. The demand exists (active Dcard threads, PTT discussions, Creatrip actively recruiting micro-influencers) but no supply-side creator has emerged. Platforms like Creatrip and KKday are filling the gap institutionally but lack the personal trust that an individual influencer provides.",
      "comparison_to_japan": "Japan has Nana (600K followers, 30 Korea trips/year), Mayu (85+ Korea visits, certified Korean beauty consultant), and multiple dedicated micro-influencers reviewing Korean clinics. Taiwan has ZERO equivalent. Alisasa (1.2M) visits Korea monthly but focuses on culture/lifestyle, not clinics. Mindy visits Korean makeup studios but not dermatology clinics. The gap is stark: Japan has at least 5-10 dedicated Korean derm tourism influencers; Taiwan has zero.",
      "micro_influencer_opportunity": "Creatrip is already recruiting Instagram creators with as few as 5,000 followers for Korean medical aesthetics content (offering 200K-1M KRW compensation). This signals the market recognizes the gap. A Taiwanese creator who speaks Korean, visits Korean dermatology clinics regularly, and documents treatments with before/after content could capture an unoccupied niche with 1.5M potential Taiwanese Korea visitors as the addressable audience. The ideal profile would be similar to Japan's Nana: monthly Korea trips, dermatology focus, real treatment documentation.",
      "platform_strategy": "Given Taiwan's social media landscape, the ideal approach would be multi-platform: YouTube for detailed clinic vlogs and treatment documentation (largest reach in Taiwan), Instagram/Threads for quick updates and clinic recommendations (visual storytelling), Dcard for community engagement and Q&A (where active Korean medical aesthetics discussion already happens), and Xiaohongshu for cross-border reach to mainland Chinese beauty tourists.",
      "barriers_to_entry": "Reasons this niche remains empty: (1) Korean medical aesthetics content requires actually undergoing treatments, creating higher cost barrier than product reviews; (2) Medical content carries regulatory sensitivity in Taiwan; (3) Language barrier - few Taiwanese creators speak Korean fluently enough for clinic consultations; (4) Existing beauty KOLs earn well from product partnerships and have little incentive to shift to clinic content; (5) Korea's medical tourism tax refund ending in 2026 may reduce demand momentum.",

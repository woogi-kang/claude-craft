## 9. Price Comparison (Korea vs Taiwan)

Korean aesthetic procedures are generally cheaper than Taiwan due to:

Common procedures and approximate pricing context:
- Radiofrequency (Thermage): Significantly cheaper in Korea
- Ultrasound (HIFU): Cheaper in Korea due to domestic manufacturing

- Botox/Fillers: Competitive pricing

**Risk factors for Taiwanese patients:**
- Post-procedure complications difficult to manage after returning to Taiwan

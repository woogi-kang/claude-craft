# Taiwanese Online Communities: Korean Dermatology & Beauty Clinic Discussions

**Research Date:** 2026-02-13
**Scope:** Taiwanese online forums, social platforms, and communities discussing Korean dermatology, skin management, and aesthetic medicine
**Language Note:** Discussions are predominantly in Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), with some mixed Korean/English terminology

---

## Executive Summary

Korean medical aesthetics (韓國醫美) has become a major discussion topic across Taiwanese online communities. In 2024, approximately 83,000 Taiwanese traveled to Korea specifically for medical aesthetic procedures, representing 7.1% of the total 1.17 million foreign medical tourists to Korea. Taiwan-to-Korea medical tourism surged 867% in 2023 compared to pre-pandemic levels. The discussion landscape is dominated by Dcard (younger demographics, 18-30) and PTT (broader age range, 25-40+), with supporting ecosystems on Pixnet blogs, Threads, LINE groups, and Xiaohongshu. A critical inflection point occurred in July 2025 when Korea announced the cancellation of the 10% medical aesthetics tax refund for foreign visitors effective January 1, 2026, significantly impacting community sentiment and discussion volume.

## 12. Cross-Platform Sentiment Analysis

### Overall Sentiment Distribution
| Sentiment | Percentage | Key Drivers |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Positive | 50-55% | Price advantage, technology, K-pop influence, package convenience |
| Negative | 25-30% | Safety risks, language barriers, post-care difficulties, ghost doctors |
| Neutral | 20-25% | Information sharing, price comparisons, procedure education |

### Most Discussed Positive Aspects
1. **Price competitiveness:** Korean procedures cost 30-70% less than equivalent Taiwan procedures
   - Ultrasound: 10-20 TWD/shot (Korea) vs. 50-100 TWD/shot (Taiwan)
   - Water light injection: ~3,000 TWD (Korea) vs. ~5,000 TWD (Taiwan)
   - Full-face fat transfer: Under 50,000 TWD (Korea) vs. significantly more in Taiwan
2. **Technology access:** Korea manufactures medical devices and injectables locally, giving clinics access to the latest equipment
3. **Celebrity/K-pop effect:** "Get the same treatment as BLACKPINK Jisoo" marketing resonates strongly
4. **Combination travel:** Medical aesthetics + shopping + food tourism package appeal

### Most Discussed Negative Aspects

3. **Language barriers:** Medical terminology miscommunication risk
4. **Post-procedure complications:** Difficulty getting follow-up care back in Taiwan
5. **Legal recourse:** Cross-border medical disputes extremely difficult to resolve

### Sentiment Shift (2025-2026)
The July 2025 tax refund cancellation announcement created a noticeable sentiment shift:
- **Pre-announcement:** Growing enthusiasm, "rush to Korea" mentality
- **Post-announcement:** More cost-benefit analysis discussions, questioning whether Korea still offers value without 10% refund
- **Some community members argue:** Taiwan's medical aesthetics quality and convenience may now be competitive

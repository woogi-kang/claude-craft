# Japan Market Research Report

An estimated 60% of Japanese women express interest in Korean beauty tours. Despite this demand, significant structural pain points persist across the entire customer journey, creating opportunities for intermediary services.

## Pain Point Analysis

### Severity Matrix

| ID | Pain Point | Severity | Frequency | Resolution Difficulty |
|----|-----------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| PP-JP-01 | Language barrier | 5/5 | 5/5 | 3/5 |
| PP-JP-02 | Aftercare absence | 5/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 |
| PP-JP-03 | Information trustworthiness | 4/5 | 5/5 | 3/5 |
| PP-JP-04 | Clinic selection overload | 4/5 | 4/5 | 3/5 |
| PP-JP-05 | Booking complexity | 3/5 | 4/5 | 2/5 |
| PP-JP-06 | Cost opacity | 3/5 | 4/5 | 3/5 |
| PP-JP-07 | Aesthetic sensibility gap | 3/5 | 3/5 | 4/5 |
| PP-JP-08 | Beginner entry barrier | 3/5 | 3/5 | 2/5 |

### Critical Pain Points (Severity 5)

**PP-JP-01: Language Barrier**
The most universally cited issue. "Natural" in Japanese aesthetic context means subtle, barely-noticeable change, while Korean clinics may interpret it as "clearly improved but not artificial." Clinic-employed interpreters face neutrality conflicts during disputes. Independent interpreter services carry risks including abandonment and theft during procedures.

**PP-JP-02: Structural Aftercare Absence**
Japanese clinics typically refuse post-treatment follow-up for procedures done abroad ("the performing clinic bears responsibility"). Foreign patient accident rates are approximately 2.3x higher than Korean patients (Korean Medical Association statistics). Cost responsibility for revision trips is undefined. Dr. Takasu (prominent Japanese surgeon) has publicly documented cases of hardened filler injections from Korean clinics requiring difficult correction.

### High-Impact Pain Points (Severity 4)

**PP-JP-03: Information Trustworthiness**
The 2026 X (Twitter) transparency feature exposed large numbers of Korean-operated accounts posing as Japanese women to promote specific clinics. Point-reward review systems create positive bias. Clinics aggressively targeting Japanese customers through advertising are often less popular among Korean locals.

**PP-JP-04: Clinic Selection Information Overload**
Information is scattered across Gangnam Unni, TRIBEAU, personal blogs, X, and Instagram. Verifying doctor credentials and specializations is difficult. Cultural aesthetic differences are poorly understood by first-time visitors.

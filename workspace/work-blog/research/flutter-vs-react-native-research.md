## Web Research

### W001: Performance Comparison
- **Source:** [Droids on Roids](https://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/flutter-vs-react-native-comparison)
- **Key Points:**
  - Flutter compiles to native ARM code - no JavaScript bridge
  - Flutter: 60-120 FPS animations vs React Native: 60 FPS
  - Startup: Flutter fastest, React Native most consistent
  - Memory: React Native (Hermes) better on Android
  - App size: Native < Flutter < React Native (Expo)

### W002: GitHub Stats 2025
- **Source:** [Nomtek](https://www.nomtek.com/blog/flutter-vs-react-native)
- **Key Points:**
  - Flutter: 170k stars vs React Native: 121k stars
  - Flutter repos: 760k (doubled from 2022-2024)
  - React Native repos: 520k
  - 46% developers use Flutter vs 35% React Native (2023)

### W003: Job Market
- **Source:** [dev.to](https://dev.to/arshtechpro/flutter-vs-react-native-vs-native-2025-which-is-better-salary-job-comparison-3bpc)
- **Key Points:**
  - LinkedIn: 6,413 React Native jobs vs 1,068 Flutter jobs (US)
  - Indeed: 1,990 React Native vs 388 Flutter (US)
  - ~6:1 ratio favoring React Native
  - Salary: $80k-$120k for both
  - Mobile dev jobs growing 21% (2018-2028)

### W004: Real-World Apps
- **Flutter Apps:**
  - Google Pay, Google Classroom
  - BMW "My BMW" app
  - Alibaba, eBay Motors
  - New York Times, Fox Sports
  - 1M+ apps built with Flutter

- **React Native Apps:**
  - Instagram, Facebook
  - Tesla, Shopify, Discord
  - Microsoft (Office, Xbox)
  - Walmart, Airbnb (formerly)
  - Bloomberg, Skype

### W005: Learning Curve
- **Source:** [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/flutter-vs-react-native)
- **Key Points:**
  - 67% developers know JavaScript (Stack Overflow 2024)
  - React Native: easier for web developers
  - Flutter/Dart: easier for complete beginners
  - Dart designed specifically for UI development

## Key Insights

### Pain Points Addressed
1. "Which framework should I learn?" - depends on background
2. "Which performs better?" - Flutter, but RN improved with Hermes
3. "Which has more jobs?" - React Native (6x more in US)
4. "Which is growing faster?" - Flutter (popularity), RN (ecosystem maturity)

### The Irony
> More developers prefer Flutter, but more jobs exist for React Native.
> Flutter is newer but growing faster. React Native is older with more legacy projects.

### Decision Framework
| Situation | Choose |
|-----------|--------|
| Know JavaScript/React | React Native |
| Complete beginner | Flutter (Dart easier) |
| UI-heavy, animations | Flutter |
| Need native APIs | React Native |
| Startup MVP fast | Flutter (FlutterFlow) |
| Enterprise/existing RN codebase | React Native |

## Suggested Outline

### Hook
"The irony: More developers prefer Flutter, but there are 6x more React Native jobs. Here's how to think about this."

### Sections
1. **The State of Cross-Platform in 2025** - Quick stats
2. **Performance: Flutter's Edge** - Compiled vs bridge
3. **Developer Experience** - JS familiarity vs Dart simplicity
4. **The Job Market Paradox** - Why the gap exists
5. **Real Apps, Real Companies** - Who uses what
6. **The Decision Framework** - When to choose which
7. **My Take** - woogi's recommendation

### Estimated Length
~1800-2000 words

### Tone
Mixed (Professional content + Casual delivery)
